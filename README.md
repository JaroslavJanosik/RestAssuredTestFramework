# RestAssuredFramework 

API Automation Framwork based on Rest Assured, Java, Maven, TestNG, OpenCSV and Extent Reports.

Test Driven Framework

****************************************************************************

How to use this framework?

Clone the repository to your workspace.

Run the testng.xml file always.

The data from a CSV file will be passed to the test method as a hashmap.

Note: If you try to run individual tests as testng test, you will get NPE as the listeners are configured in testng.xml
